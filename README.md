# ðŸ§ª Link Prediction Algorithms  

## Adamic-Adar Algorithm

The Adamic-Adar algorithm was introduced in 2003 by Lada Adamic and Eytan Adar. It's designed to predict links in a social network by measuring the closeness between pairs of nodes. The algorithm calculates the similarity between nodes based on the commonality of their connections, using the following formula:

The formula essentially sums the inverse logarithm of the degree of common neighbors between two nodes. Here, `N(u)` represents the set of nodes adjacent to node `u`. A computed value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not close, suggesting no common neighbors, while higher values signify a closer relationship, indicating multiple shared connections.

### Key Points:

- **Purpose:** Predicts the likelihood of a future link between two nodes in a social network.
- **Interpretation:** A higher Adamic-Adar score implies a stronger relationship or connection likelihood between the nodes based on their shared neighbors.
- **Usage:** The library provides a function to calculate the closeness between two nodes.
